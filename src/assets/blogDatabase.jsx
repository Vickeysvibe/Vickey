          "Dreams are a series of thoughts, images, and sensations that occurs in apersons mind during sleep. They can be vivid and realistic, or abstractand surreal. The exact function and purpose of dream is not fully understood, but they are thought to play a role in memory consolidation and emotional regulation. Many theories have been proposed to explain the nature of dreams psychological, biological, and philosophical explanations.",

          "Dreaming occurs during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of the sleep, which typically takes place in the latter half of the night. During REM sleep, the sub-conscious brain is highly active and the eyes move rapidly behind the closed eyelids. This stage is characterized by vivid and intense dreams as well as a temporary paralysis of the muscles, preventing the person form physically acting out the dreams.",

          "A lucid dream is a type of dream in which the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming and had some level of control over the dream’s content. In a lucid dream. The dreamer is able to actively participate in and influence the dream, rather than simply observe it. This awareness can be accompanied by a range of experiences such as vivid imaginary, intense emotions and sense of control. Lucid dreaming can be induced through techniques such as dreaming journaling, reality testing, and meditation.",

        content:
          "Yes!, There are a few techniques that can be used to trigger a lucid dream, such as reality testing, dream journaling, and finger tapping. It is also possible to use external stimuli such as light or sound to induce lucid dream. Lucid dreams can be triggered by giving any type of sensory signals to the brain such as a sense of vibration (particular frequency) mild enough to still keep us dreaming, but to be sensed by the nervous system to bring our brain back to consciousness, at a constant interval of time to make the mind conscious, and thus we can know we are in a dream and manipulate it according to our wish.",

          "Dreamizer is a smart band which contains vibration motors which is used to deliver mild vibrations in your wrist nerves at a preset timing according to the REM stage of the sleep on which we are in a dream, which sends a nervous signal to the brain causing the activation of our consciousness, and thus you will gain consciousness in your present dream. These vibrations occur at a regular interval of time to keep your brain in a constant conscious state. Other than just being a device to manipulate dreams it is also a smart band which contains all the features many smart bands have Such as heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking and other basic time functions. <br /> <br /> Being a device to be used majorly during night times, it has a heart attack detector which alerts everyone by sensing the heart rate, It has a dedicated SOS Button which when pressed three times alerts the selected contacts via messages with a GPS location address with a an included voice mail when encountering an emergency situation. <br /> <br /> In nineteenth-century German chemist August Kekule claimed to have pictured the ring structure of the benzene after dreaming of a snake eating its own tail. Many inventions such as the periodic table, structure of atom, and even the theory of relativity were created from the inspiration from dreams. <br /> <br /> As a matter of fact an average human spends an average of about 2 hours a day dreaming, and for lifetime we spend about 10 years just for dreaming. Imagine if we could use that time to experience unimaginable things, practice any real word skills or even experiment anything as dreams are just imaginary world of anything could think of... You can even boost your creativity and level of thinking or you can just use it for entertainment.",
